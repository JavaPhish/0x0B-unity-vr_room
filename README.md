# A virtual reality escape room demo
Created in Unity  2019.4.21f1 - built for Oculus platform

This project was my first dive into room-scale VR and I used it as an opportunity to practice 3d modeling, programming and game design skills. The models used in the challenges/puzzles (Padlock/key and the projector puzzle slots) were 3d modeled and designed by me.

## Gameplay Description (Spoilers!)
Players must turn on the projector to complete the game, however they must figure out how to get into the projector room and even figure out how to turn it on once there.

The escape room consists of two main puzzles in two separate rooms.


#### Room 1 (Storage):
Find the key to unlock the door
